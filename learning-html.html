  Brain: Nice to be talking to you again Nina.
  
  Me: Why do you say it like that? 
  
  Brain: Well, you're not the most intruiging person. And, to be honest I can't get you to be quiet! No matter how many times I sabatoge you so you'll be quiet! 
  
  Me: Woah buddy! You sabatoge me to be quiet? You're my brain not the other way around. When we're done with this interview we are going to have a little talk.
  
  Brain: *groans dramtically* You can be such a pest! But, frankly you are right let's get down to this interview.
  
  Me: Alright.
  
  Brain: What is your top favorite song?
  
  Me: Huh? Um... I would have to say Wake me up by Aviccii. :)
  
  Brain: *laughs hysterically* Him? I was expecting Rigoletto or something of the sort. 
  
  Me: Why? What's wrong with Avicii. He's a terrific songwriter! 
  
  Brain: Who is intwerviewing you?
  
  Me: You are.
  
  Brain: That's right. I ask the questions! Understood? Or, should I talk about Don Giovanii? Your call.
  
  Me: *heavy sigh* Yes sir. I understand completely. And, I apaologize for bieng smart with you.
  
  Brain: Well, this interview is over. I already have a terrible headache from you babbiling on and on. *groans* Good bye Nina.
  
  Me: I'm sorry. And, good night brain.
